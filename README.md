Emerging Trends in CS

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project I was supplied with the PY files that this notebook utilizes and some starter code.  I coded the training algorithm for the AI system.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists can train artificial neural networks in order to solve complex problems or problems with ambiguity that would make a solution very difficult to explicitly code.  This can help to solve problems that would otherwise be unsolvable.  For example, conceivable an AI system could help to increase the efficiency of an electrical grid.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
In order to train an AI system to solve an issue I first have to identify what dataset can be used to teach the AI system. Once the dataset is prepared an algorithm can be designed that uses the dataset both to train and to test the AI system.  Once the model is trained and is shown to be accurate it can be apllied to real-world problems.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I am responsible to think of the implications of the AI systems I create and ensure that any negative consequences are mitigated.  I am responsible to ensure that the datasets I use to train AI systems are accurate and the biases are minimized.  I am also responsible for education users of the system that it utilizes AI and that there is a potential for uncaught biases and inaccuracies.
